# Task Tracker

## About 

This application allows the user to track time-sensitive tasks. The user can type a short description of each task, input the date for completion, and flag a reminder. This version of the application only includes the front end, so the reminders are stored within the application itself. If the page is refreshed, or if the user leaves the page, the changes will be erased.

## Development

The purpose of creating this application was to practice using React. This application uses many important React concepts, including components, props, and states. 

I wrote this application by following along with [Traversy Media's 2021 React Crash Course](https://github.com/bradtraversy/react-crash-2021).
